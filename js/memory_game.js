/*Assignment #5 - Memory Game
______________________________________________________________________________________
The following exercise contains the following subjects:
o JavaScript: Events handling, DOM Manipulation
o HTML / CSS, Bootstrap

Understanding the task:
1. The board size should be 3 * 4; The cards should be dealt in random, every card has a match.
2. When the user wins, pop up a “You won!” overlay with a new game button.
3. Create a header with a “new game” button
4. The game page has to be mobile responsive
Important features:
● After flipping two cards with different images, the game should pause for a second.During that
second, the other cards are not clickable.
● Don’t wait to finish your project before you commit your code to GitHub.Commit whenever you added
an important functionality.
● Make sure your JS code is using functions and well commented.
Geek out:
1. Add number of wrong guesses counter(put it anywhere).The “you won” overlay should show them.
2. Add the ability to change the game theme(both images and card pattern).
3. Make the basic layout the “easy” level, add levels medium and hard(with more 18 and 24 cards).
Unleash the ninja within:
1. Add flipping animation effect for the card.
2. Add a high score functionality, that will save the name of the person with the least amounts of wrong
guesses.*/
